          <p className="m-8 mt-0 mr-32">UCSD practices contemporary Chinese wushu, an exhibition martial art developed after 1949 in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China based on traditional Chinese martial arts. Wushu performances and competition are based on routines, called forms (taolu), in various events representing different styles and types of weapons used in traditional Chinese martial arts. In addition, there is also sparring (sanda), although the club does not practice sparring.</p>
